# About Me

Hello, my name is Gabriel Grajeda. I am currently an undergraduate at Princeton University. My projects are listed below with descriptions. Feel free to email me at [ggrajeda@princeton.edu]() with any questions or comments.

# Boston ZIP Earnings

### Summary
I created the Boston ZIP Earnings Project in summer 2020. The point of the project is to depict household income disparities between Boston neighborhoods. City employee earnings are used as a proxy for household income, because these figures are reported yearly. More information can be found on the [project website](https://ggrajeda.github.io/boston-zip-earnings/).

# Coding Car

### Summary
I created the Coding Car project in summer 2016, when I was a rising junior in high school. The point of the project is to introduce kids to coding in a more entertaining way. When the project was up and running, students would visit [this website](https://ggrajeda.github.io/coding-car/) (looks best on Chrome) and learn to program a remote-controlled car at three different levels: **Play**, **Learn**, and **Get Coding!**.

In _Play_, kids would press buttons to control the car. The buttons are labelled in pure English (no programming syntax yet), with each button belonging to a group of car controls (e.g. Direction, Headlights). It's important to note that you don't control the car with a joystick, but with buttons. The point of the _Play_ section is not just for students to play around with the controls and have fun as they would with a normal RC car, but for them to get an intuitive grasp for subdividing routines. For example, to make a full loop around an oval track, you need to go forwards for a while, turn left for a bit, go forwards again for a while, and then turn left once more. While this seems obvious, we found that kids benefitted from learning to break larger tasks (like completing a lap around a track) into smaller subroutines.

In _Learn_, kids familiarized themselves with coding syntax. There are parentheses and a semicolon after every command. Moreover, the _Learn_ section builds upon the _Play_ section. Whereas buttons may have been organized into groups before, commands are now listed together. Students are meant to have an intuition about which commands are useful in a subroutine&mdash;and which are not.

In _Get Coding!_, kids write full-length programs to control their car. Note that the leap from _Learn_ to _Get Coding!_ is larger than that from _Play_ to _Learn_. Students must now plan out a program with the syntax introduced in the previous section. While _Play_ and _Learn_ offer students a way to interact with the car in real-time, the _Get Coding!_ section only allows students to pass in one block of code at a time. To get the car to make laps around a track, students must invest time in planning out the course, performing trial runs, and editing their program. To allow for easier coding, a `wait(double ms)` function is introduced, to keep the car in a certain state (e.g. driving straight, turning, or beeping) for a certain number of milliseconds.

### Pros
I think the main draw of this project is that it can help young students learn to code&mdash;especially students who may initially seem disinterested in programming. One of the central issues in trying to promote computer science education to kids is that young students can find programming boring, especially when the subject is taught through the wrong lens. Unsurprisingly, I have found that coding becomes more appealing when it is presented as a game or a puzzle (`for` loops aren't very interesting on their own).

I am proud of the project's aesthetic. The color scheme is interesting, and the font is kid-friendly and easy on the eyes.

### Cons
This was my first attempt at coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was a lot to learn over a single summer, and so there were some things that I would have liked to develop more. The first is a way to provide feedback when the user enters erroneous code in the _Get Coding!_ section. Watching the car stop moving halfway through your code because you forgot a semicolon is not a fun experience. The second is that I would have liked to make a slightly nicer text editor in the _Get Coding!_ section. Maybe the color of the text could change green for function names, white for parentheses and semicolons, and red for unrecognized terms?

Because I was learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript all at once, I sacrificed code design for code functionality. In other words, I wanted to get working code&mdash;not necessarily beautiful code. This means that the source code is quite messy, which I regret, as it is difficult to edit the project many years later. But perhaps this messiness can be excused by the fact that I hadn't yet taken any formal computer science classes at the time.

Finally, the website only worked with my personal car. If I had made more cars, I could have assigned each one a key to be passed in before entering the website.

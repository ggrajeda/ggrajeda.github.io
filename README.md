## About Me

Hello, my name is Gabriel Grajeda. I am currently an undergraduate at Princeton University. My projects are listed below with descriptions. Feel free to email me at [ggrajeda@princeton.edu]() with any questions or comments.

## Boston ZIP Earnings Project

### Summary
I created the Boston ZIP Earnings Project to show how median city employee earnings have evolved over the past decade in the neighborhoods of Boston. I was originally interested in looking at this data because my mother is a teacher in the Boston Public Schools. I found that there were significant disparities in median city employee salaries between Boston neighborhoods, even after blocking Boston city employees into groups of comparable education and profession. The Boston ZIP Earnings Project makes this issue of economic segregation easier to visualize through the use of choropleth maps. More details can be found on the [repo's README](https://github.com/ggrajeda/boston-zip-earnings) or the [project website](https://ggrajeda.github.io/boston-zip-earnings/).

### Note
This project is currently undergoing review to be hosted on the City of Boston's [Analyze Boston Showcase](https://data.boston.gov/showcase).

## Coding Car

### Summary
I created the Coding Car project in summer 2016, when I was a rising junior in high school. The point of the project is to introduce kids to coding in a more entertaining way. When the project was up and running, students would visit [this website](https://ggrajeda.github.io/coding-car/) (looks best on Chrome) and learn to program a remote-controlled car at three different levels: **Play**, **Learn**, and **Get Coding!**. More details can be found on the [repo's README](https://github.com/ggrajeda/coding-car).
